# Predict-The-Cancer-Death-Rate-For-Given-Year


Cancer is the second leading cause of death globally, and is responsible for an estimated 9.6 million deaths in 2018. Globally, about 1 in 6 deaths is due to cancer. Many aspects of the behaviour of cancer disease are highly unpredictable. Even with the huge number of studies that have been done on the DNA mutation responsible for the disease, we are still unable to use these information at clinical level. However, it is important that we understand the effects and impacts of this disease from the past information as much as we possibly can. Therefore we will build a machine learning model that would predict the cancer death rate for the given year.
